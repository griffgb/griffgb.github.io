        I love music and believe that to truly appreciate an artist or album, you need to
        listen to the entire album rather than just individual songs. Previously, I used my
        personal Discord to share my thoughts, embedding links to albums, picking my top
        three songs from each album, giving an overall score out of 10, and writing a short
        description explaining my rating. However, it became challenging to keep track of
        the albums I had already listened to and reviewed. To solve this, I decided to create
        a website called "Music Journal" where I can store and organize my album reviews more effectively.

      This project, completed in Fall 2024, is an Android application designed to make 
      event registration at community centers more accessible and equitable. The app 
      uses a lottery-based system to allow participants to join waiting lists for popular events, 
      removing the time pressure often associated with first-come, first-serve registrations. 
      It was developed by a team of six, all practicing software engineering principles, and 
      features a pooling system for fair participant selection, QR code scanning for event 
      details, Firebase integration for real-time updates, multi-user roles, and optional 
      geolocation verification. With an A-grade evaluation. The class introduced me to UML 
      and the processes involved in developing an app while collaborating effectively in a team.
