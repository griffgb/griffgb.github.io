        I love music and believe that to truly appreciate an artist or album, you need to
        listen to the entire album rather than just individual songs. Previously, I used my
        personal Discord to share my thoughts, embedding links to albums, picking my top
        three songs from each album, giving an overall score out of 10, and writing a short
        description explaining my rating. However, it became challenging to keep track of
        the albums I had already listened to and reviewed. To solve this, I decided to create
        a website called "Music Journal" where I can store and organize my album reviews more effectively.

        Music Journal allows users to create accounts, log their favorite albums, and write detailed reviews.
        Each review includes a rating, top three favorite songs, and an optional description. The app was
        built using Java for the backend, CSS and HTML for the frontend, and MongoDB for storing user data
        and album reviews. The app lets the user search up any album using the MusicBrainzAPI and the Cover Art 
        Archive API. The app also includes a friend request feature, though viewing friends' rated albums has
        yet to be implemented. I wanted the website to evoke the nostalgic feel of the golden age of websites 
        (2006–2008).  Rather than adopting a sleek, modern design like Spotify, I opted for a raw, HTML-heavy 
        aesthetic reminiscent of early web designs. To enhance this vibe, I created most of the visuals myself, 
        infusing the site with a grungy, early-2000s look.

        This project, completed in Fall 2024, is an Android application designed to make 
        registration at community centers more accessible and equitable. The app uses a 
        lottery-based system to allow participants to join waiting lists for popular events, 
        removing the time pressure often associated with first-come, first-serve registrations. It 
        was developed by a team of six, all practicing software engineering principles, and
        features a pooling system for fair participant selection, QR code scanning for event 
        details, Firebase integration for real-time updates, multi-user roles, and optional
        geolocation verification. The app’s user-friendly design ensures accessibility for
        individuals with limitations such as work schedules or disabilities. With an A-grade 
        evaluation.
