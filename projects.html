    I love music and believe that to truly appreciate an artist or album, you need to
    listen to the entire album rather than just individual songs. Previously, I used my
    personal Discord to share my thoughts, embedding links to albums, picking my top
    three songs from each album, giving an overall score out of 10, and writing a short
    description explaining my rating. However, it became challenging to keep track of
    the albums I had already listened to and reviewed. To solve this, I decided to create
    a website called "Music Journal" where I can store and organize my album reviews more effectively.

        <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 20px;">
        Music Journal allows users to create accounts, log their favorite albums, and write detailed reviews.
        Each review includes a rating, top three favorite songs, and an optional description. The app was
        built using Java for the backend, CSS and HTML for the frontend, and MongoDB for storing user data
        and album reviews. The app lets the user search up any album using the MusicBrainzAPI and the Cover Art 
        Archive API. The app also includes a friend request feature, though viewing friends' rated albums has
        yet to be implemented. I wanted the website to evoke the nostalgic feel of the golden age of websites 
        (2006â€“2008). Rather than adopting a sleek, modern design like Spotify, I opted for a raw, HTML-heavy 
        aesthetic reminiscent of early web designs. To enhance this vibe, I created most of the visuals myself, 
        infusing the site with a grungy, early-2000s look.

      This project, completed in Fall 2024, is an Android application designed to make 
      event registration at community centers more accessible and equitable. The app 
      uses a lottery-based system to allow participants to join waiting lists for popular events, 
      removing the time pressure often associated with first-come, first-serve registrations. 
      It was developed by a team of six, all practicing software engineering principles, and 
      features a pooling system for fair participant selection, QR code scanning for event 
      details, Firebase integration for real-time updates, multi-user roles, and optional 
      geolocation verification. With an A-grade evaluation. The class introduced me to UML 
      and the processes involved in developing an app while collaborating effectively in a team.

</pre>

<p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 20px;">
  This project involved creating a mock Twitter application that ran entirely in the terminal. 
  The first version was built using SQL, focusing on relational database design and efficient queries. 
  The second version improved upon the first by switching to MongoDB, incorporating non-relational 
  database concepts for scalability and flexibility. Both projects strengthened my understanding 
  of database management and query optimization.
