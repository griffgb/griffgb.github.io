    <span class="comment">// CMPUT 229: Computer Organization and Architecture I</span>
    <span class="string">
    This was the hardest yet most rewarding class Iâ€™ve taken in my degree. We 
    with RISC-V and learned about how computers operate at a low level, 
    including number representation, instruction sets, assembly-level programming, 
    and memory management. Topics like pipelining, datapath, and virtual memory
    gave me a new appreciation for how hardware and software work together. It 
    was incredibly challenging, but it was fascinating to get so close to
    understanding how computers function at their core. This class gave me a much 
    deeper respect for the complexity and design of computer systems.

    <span class="comment">// CMPUT 291: Introduction to File and Database Management</span>
    <span class="string">
    In this class, I learned the basics of organizing and processing data, diving into
    concepts like the entity-relationship model, relational databases, and SQL. We also
    explored storage architecture and access methods, and I got hands-on with relational 
    and non-relational databases like MongoDB. The course included two group projects
    where we built a mock Twitter application, which made using SQL and MongoDB 
    both practical and fun. Working on these projects showed me how powerful databases 
    are and got me really interested in data management and organization.

    <span class="comment">// CMPUT 301: Introduction to Software Engineering</span>
    <span class="string">
    In this class, I learned the fundamentals of object-oriented design and analysis,
    focusing on building interactive applications. We worked with tools like Android
    Studio and used UML to plan and design software. The highlight of the course 
    was working in a group of six classmates to develop an app over the entire 
    semester. We collaborated on everything from gathering client requirements to
    designing, testing, and presenting our app. It was a hands-on experience that 
    taught me how to work in a team, communicate with a client, and follow the
    software development process from start to finish.

    <span class="comment">// CMPUT 455: Search, Knowledge, and Simulation</span>
    <span class="string">
    In this class, I learned how computers make smart decisions in games using 
    search algorithms, simulations, and machine learning. We explored how neural 
    networks work and how they can help computers think ahead and make better 
    moves. It was a great mix of theory and hands-on techniques, giving me insight 
    into cutting-edge AI strategies for games like Chess or Go.
